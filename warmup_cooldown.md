## 8. Warm-Up & Cool-Down Protocols

The engine should not treat these as throwaway distance. They must follow a specific progression based on the Main Set focus.

### A. Warm-Up Logic (15-20% of Total Volume)
The warm-up block is constructed in three phases:

1.  **Loosening (40-50% of Warm-up Dist):**
    * **Focus:** General movement.
    * **Intensity:** Z1 (Recovery).
    * **Structure:** Continuous swim or long reps.
    * *Example:* `300m Choice Swim.`

2.  **Activation (30-40% of Warm-up Dist):**
    * **Focus:** Engagement of legs and core; neural connection.
    * **Structure:** Mix of **Kick** and **Drill**.
    * *Example:* `4 x 50m (25 Kick / 25 Drill).`

3.  **Priming (20% of Warm-up Dist):**
    * **Focus:** Preparation for the specific Main Set intensity.
    * **Logic Branch:**
        * *If Focus = Endurance/Threshold:* Do **Build** sets (Z1 -> Z3).
        * *If Focus = Speed/Sprint:* Do **Variable** speed (Easy w/ fast breakouts).
    * *Example:* `4 x 25m Build` OR `4 x 25m (12.5 Fast / 12.5 Easy).`

### B. Cool-Down Logic (10-15% of Total Volume)
The cool-down is simpler but strictly governed by intensity caps.

* **Focus:** Active Recovery / Flushing.
* **Intensity:** Strictly **Z1**.
* **Structure:** Continuous easy swimming.
* **Engine Rule:** If Main Set intensity was >Z3 (Anaerobic), Cool-down volume should ideally be higher (closer to 15-20% if time permits) to clear lactate.
* *Example:* `200m Easy Choice (Double Arm Backstroke recommended).
