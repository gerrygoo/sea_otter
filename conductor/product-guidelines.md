# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** Clean and Minimalist.
*   **Priority:** High legibility and utility. The interface must be readable at a glance on a mobile device, potentially in wet conditions or under harsh pool lighting.
*   **UI Elements:** High contrast ratios, large touch targets, and a focus on essential data without unnecessary visual clutter.

## Communication & Voice
*   **Tone:** Functional and Direct. The application serves as a high-performance tool; the language should be concise, professional, and efficient.
*   **Instructional Style:** 
    *   **Primary:** Expert-to-Expert shorthand. Use standard competitive swimming terminology (e.g., "500 w/u", "4x100 @ 1:30 Desc. 1-4", "200 IM Kick/Drill by 25").
    *   **Secondary:** Progressive Detail. While the summary view uses shorthand, users should be able to navigate to or expand a detailed view that provides more context for complex drills or specific set goals if needed.

## User Experience Principles
*   **Poolside First:** The app is primarily intended for use on the pool deck. All critical workout information must be accessible with minimal interaction.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimize the time spent between finishing one set and starting the next.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure that workout serialization is robust and adheres to standards that allow for future external integration.
