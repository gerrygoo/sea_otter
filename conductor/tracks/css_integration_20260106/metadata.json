  "description": "We need to add critical swim speed as an input parameter of our generator app. this parameter, alongside with other parameters such as the main focus, should inform the generated pace expectations in workouts. at css pace it's considered 'neutral' effort. below is easier (for warm up or cool down). a pace above CSS is harder (for harder, strong part of workout in the middle)."
